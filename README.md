# ankiQuiz
For when you can't cram anymore. Automatic quiz maker for Anki.

Should create 'quizlet style' quizes / exams. These could be for example multichoice questions. These aren't intended to replace reviews, they are to supplement them.

# Note the plugin doesn't even have basic functionality yet, this will be implemented with time.
